# Logical Operators in JavaScript

## Introduction

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and return a boolean value based on the logic of the expressions. In JavaScript, logical operators are essential for making decisions in your code.

## Overview

Logical operators can be applied to Boolean values to "reason" about them. JavaScript supports three logical operators: **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**.

## Types of Logical Operators

JavaScript provides three main logical operators:
1. **AND (`&&`)**
2. **OR (`||`)**
3. **NOT (`!`)**

## AND Operator (`&&`)

The AND operator returns `true` if both operands are `true`. If either operand is `false`, it returns `false`.

### Syntax
```javascript
condition1 && condition2
```

### Example
```javascript
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a && b); // Output: false

let c = 5;
let d = 10;

console.log(c > 0 && d < 20); // Output: true
```

### Explanation
- In the first example, `a && b` evaluates to `false` because `b` is `false`.
- In the second example, both conditions `c > 0` and `d < 20` are `true`, so `c > 0 && d < 20` evaluates to `true`.

### Logical AND (&&)

The `&&` operator represents logical AND. It is a binary operator, and its result is `true` only if both values given to it are `true`.

#### Examples:
```javascript
console.log(true && false); // → false
console.log(true && true);  // → true
```

## OR Operator (`||`)

The OR operator returns `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`. If both operands are `false`, it returns `false`.

### Syntax
```javascript
condition1 || condition2
```

### Example
```javascript
let e = true;
let f = false;

console.log(e || f); // Output: true

let g = 5;
let h = 10;

console.log(g > 10 || h < 20); // Output: true
```

### Explanation
- In the first example, `e || f` evaluates to `true` because `e` is `true`.
- In the second example, `g > 10` is `false` but `h < 20` is `true`, so `g > 10 || h < 20` evaluates to `true`.

### Logical OR (||)

The `||` operator denotes logical OR. It produces `true` if either of the values given to it is `true`.

#### Examples:
```javascript
console.log(false || true);  // → true
console.log(false || false); // → false
```

## NOT Operator (`!`)

The NOT operator returns `true` if the operand is `false` and returns `false` if the operand is `true`. It essentially inverts the boolean value.

### Syntax
```javascript
!condition
```

### Example
```javascript
let i = true;

console.log(!i); // Output: false

let j = 0;

console.log(!j); // Output: true
```

### Explanation
- In the first example, `!i` inverts `true` to `false`.
- In the second example, `j` is `0` (which is falsy in JavaScript), so `!j` evaluates to `true`.

### Logical NOT (!)

The `!` operator represents logical NOT. It is a unary operator that flips the value given to it. `!true` produces `false` and `!false` gives `true`.

#### Examples:
```javascript
console.log(!true);  // → false
console.log(!false); // → true
```

## Combining Logical Operators

Logical operators can be combined to form more complex conditions.

### Example
```javascript
let k = 5;
let l = 10;
let m = 15;

console.log((k < l) && (l < m)); // Output: true
console.log((k > l) || (l < m)); // Output: true
console.log(!(k < m)); // Output: false
```

### Explanation
- `(k < l) && (l < m)` evaluates to `true` because both conditions are `true`.
- `(k > l) || (l < m)` evaluates to `true` because `l < m` is `true`.
- `!(k < m)` inverts `true` to `false`.

## Operator Precedence

When mixing Boolean operators with arithmetic and other operators, it is essential to understand their precedence. The order from lowest to highest precedence is:
1. `||` (logical OR)
2. `&&` (logical AND)
3. Comparison operators (`>`, `==`, etc.)
4. Arithmetic and other operators

This order helps minimize the need for parentheses in typical expressions. For example:
```javascript
1 + 1 == 2 && 10 * 10 > 50
```

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator (`?:`)

The conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator) operates on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon: `a ? b : c`.

### Examples:
```javascript
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);  // → 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2); // → 2
```

The operator uses the value to the left of the question mark to decide which of the two other values to "pick". If you write `a ? b : c`, the result will be `b` when `a` is `true` and `c` otherwise.

## Conclusion

Logical operators are fundamental in controlling the flow of your JavaScript programs. They allow you to create complex conditional statements and make your code more dynamic and functional.
