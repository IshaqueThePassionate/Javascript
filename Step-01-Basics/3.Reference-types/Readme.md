Creating a README file for JavaScript reference types with definitions and examples would look something like this:

# JavaScript Reference Types

In JavaScript, reference types are data types that hold references (or pointers) to objects stored in memory. When you work with reference types, assigning them to variables or passing them to functions does not create a new copy of the underlying data but rather a reference to the original data. This means changes to one reference affect all references pointing to the same object.

## Types of Reference Types

### 1. Objects

Objects are complex data types that include key-value pairs of properties and methods. When you assign an object to a variable, you're actually assigning a reference to that object.

```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "John" };
let obj2 = obj1; // obj2 now references the same object as obj1
```

### 2. Arrays

Arrays are special types of objects that store multiple values in a single variable. Assigning an array to another variable copies the reference, not the array itself.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1; // arr2 now references the same array as arr1
```

### 3. Functions

Functions in JavaScript are also objects. When you assign a function to a variable, that variable holds a reference to the function object.

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

let greetReference = greet; // greetReference now references the greet function
```

### 4. Classes and Instances

Classes define blueprints for creating objects with specific properties and methods. Instances of classes are reference types.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

let person1 = new Person("Alice");
let person2 = person1; // person2 now references the same instance as person1
```

### 5. Closures

Closures are functions that have access to variables from their containing scope even after the parent function has finished executing. They maintain references to their outer scope variables.

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

let closure1 = outer();
closure1(); // Output: 1
closure1(); // Output: 2
```

### 6. Maps and Sets

Maps and sets are collections of keyed data and unique values, respectively, that store references to objects.

```javascript
let map = new Map();
let obj = { key: "value" };
map.set(obj, "some value"); // Map stores a reference to obj
```
